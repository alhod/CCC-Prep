# CCC-Prep

Hello!

My name is Andrew Deng. As of writing this, I am in eleventh grade, attending Bur Oak Secondary School, and it is January 31st, 2023. The Canadian Computing Competition will take place on February 15th, 2023. The folders and files found within "CCC-Prep" consist of some of the practice problems and data structures and algorithms I used to prepare for this competition. Hope you find them helpful!
